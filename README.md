#ModMaker
========

Windows Command Line program that helps out with making mods for Dota 2.

##Roadmap:
* Create a bare mod folder with all the required files (except for the map files) for running a mod inside Dota 2.
* Validate the KV files in an existing mod, automatic or manual.

##Help out:
This is my first ever C++ project so pull requests with enhancements and tips are greatly appricated. 

##Releases:
